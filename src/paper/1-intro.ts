## How safe is “safe”? How risky is “risky”?

You’re already familiar with some rules of thumb for avoiding COVID-19 infection: wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, and only socialize outdoors. But _just how much_ do these things help? How big a deal is it if you remove your mask when hanging out with a friend? What happens if you get closer than 6ft? Bars and restaurants are opening, but is it safe to go inside? It’s tough to make good choices when you don’t know how large or small the risks really are.

We—the authors—were really struggling with this. We wanted a rigorous way to make decisions about COVID risk. So we did some research and crunched some numbers.  We trawled the scientific literature for data.  We spent hours estimating the COVID risk of various activities. And in this blog post, we’ll share our research (and some practical tools!) with you.

We’ll show you:

- How we measure COVID infection risk, in units of “microCOVIDs”
- How risky we think various common activities are
- How you can estimate the COVID risk of your own actions (using our handy-dandy COVID risk calculator TODO link)
- And, most importantly, how to make decisions that balance freedom and fun with safety and health.

You’re in the target audience of this post if you are comfortable with numbers and want to think about how your personal choices affect your chance of getting COVID-19. We are not focusing on society-wide pandemic dynamics, policy responses, or suggestions for public health officials.

This is the first part of a two-part post. In the second part [TODO link], we’ll go into more detail about how we use these COVID risk estimates as part of a “risk budget” system for our communal house.

_Disclaimer: This article (and corresponding calculator) was collaboratively written by the members and friends of Ibasho, a communal house in San Francisco. Our goal is to protect our community’s physical and mental health during the pandemic, by promoting balanced evidence-based decision-making by individual citizens. We have based our numbers in this article on scientific research; however, none of us are epidemiologists and our model is still a guess and not an authoritative “truth”.
