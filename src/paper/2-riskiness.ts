# 2. The riskiness of daily interactions is measured in “microCOVIDs”

You might have seen images categorizing COVID risk as [“high”, “medium”, or “low”](https://twitter.com/SaskiaPopescu/status/1279133758965248000) or rating activities on [a riskiness scale from 1 through 9](https://www.newsweek.com/texas-doctors-rank-1-9-risks-catching-covid-19-these-activities-1515790). This is helpful, but personally we found that we had to dig further—into actual numbers—so we could make confident decisions.

Calling an event “high risk” seems to us is like categorizing a furniture purchase as “expensive.” If I’m buying a rug, and I know it’s “expensive”, but it would really complete the look of my room, can I afford to splurge this time? Maybe, or maybe not! If the rug is $100, that might be a sensible purchase. But if the rug is $10,000 then I might have difficulty paying for rent and groceries if I buy it!
