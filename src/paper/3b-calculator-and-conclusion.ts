### Calculator

It can be pretty annoying to calculate microCOVIDs for every activity you’re considering. With that in mind, we developed a calculator tool to help you estimate and multiply the Person Risk, Activity Risk, and any modifiers for safer behavior (like wearing a mask), to get an estimated number of microCOVIDs from a given activity.

Check it out here: [https://www.microcovid.org/calculator](Calculator)

It’s pretty amazing! You can give it your local COVID infection rate and the type of activity you’ll be doing, and it will tell you the “cost” of your activity in microCOVIDs. 

We think it’s especially powerful as a way to hone your intuition. Try putting your activities from last week into the calculator. How many microCOVIDs do they add up to?

### Conclusion

We hope our mindset towards COVID risk modeling makes you feel less trapped and more free to live a safe(r) COVID life. We have a couple of requests:

First, please use the calculator! We hope it helps you in your own life. Let us know if you have any feedback. 


Second, let us know if you’d like to contribute! Please reach out to us at info@microcovid.org if you would like to get involved. TODO fix email address.

Thanks for reading!
