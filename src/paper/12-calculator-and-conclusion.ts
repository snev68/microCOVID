### Calculator

It can be pretty annoying to calculate microCOVIDs for every activity you’re considering. With that in mind, we developed a calculator tool to help you estimate and multiply the Person Risk, Activity Risk, and any modifiers for safer behavior (like wearing a mask), to get an estimated number of microCOVIDs from a given activity.

Check it out here: [https://www.microcovid.org/calculator](/calculator)

It’s pretty amazing! You can give it your local COVID infection rate and the type of activity you’ll be doing, and it will tell you the “cost” of your activity in microCOVIDs.

We think it’s especially powerful as a way to hone your intuition. Try putting some of your activities from last week into the calculator. Which activity had the largest cost? How many microCOVIDs do your actions add up to? How much of that total comes from members of your household, and how much from your activity outside the house?

### Conclusion

We hope our mindset towards COVID risk modeling makes you feel less trapped and more free to live a safe(r) COVID life. We have a couple of requests:

First, please use the calculator! We hope it helps you in your own life. Let us know if you have any feedback.

Second, if you would like to contribute, please email info@microcovid.org. Or -- even better, if you are able to! -- submit a [pull request](https://github.com/microcovid/microcovid) with your contribution.

Thanks for reading!
