### Understanding COVID transmission

First, we’d like to strengthen your intuitive model of COVID transmission.

COVID is transmitted primarily through tiny droplets produced when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes (CDC FAQ), many of which can remain suspended in the air for minutes to hours. Touching contaminated surfaces or objects is possibly a way that COVID spreads, but the CDC believes the main way it spreads is from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Therefore, in this post, we focus primarily on the risk from exhaled droplets in the air. 

We suggest a helpful metaphor from our friend Matt Bell—think of everyone around you exhaling cigarette smoke. If someone is smoking a cigarette in a park 30 feet away from you, you might not even smell it. But in a crowded bar where indoor smoking is permitted, the air will be thick with people’s smoky exhalations.

If you inhale just a bit of “smoke” from someone with COVID, you might be fine. But if you inhale lots of “smoke,” you’re likely to get COVID. If you’re wondering about the riskiness of a situation, then it’s helpful to imagine, “What if everyone here were smoking a cigarette? How much smoke would I breathe?”  If you’d be breathing other people’s smoke, then it’s a risky situation.
