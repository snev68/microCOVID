## How safe is “safe”? How risky is “risky”?

You’re already familiar with some rules of thumb for avoiding COVID-19 infection: wear a mask, stay 6 feet apart, and only socialize outdoors. But *just how much* do these things help? How big a deal is it if you remove your mask when hanging out with a friend? What happens if you get closer than 6ft? Bars and restaurants are opening, but is it safe to go inside? It’s tough to make good choices when you don’t know how large or small the risks really are.

We—the authors—were really struggling with this. We wanted a rigorous way to make decisions about COVID risk. So we did some research and crunched some numbers.  We trawled the scientific literature for data.  We spent hours estimating the COVID risk of various activities. And in this blog post, we’ll share our research (and some practical tools!) with you.

We’ll show you:

- How we measure COVID infection risk, in units of “microCOVIDs”
- Exactly how risky various common activities are
- How you can estimate the COVID risk of your own actions (using our handy-dandy COVID risk calculator)
- And, most importantly, how to make decisions that balance freedom and fun with safety and health.
